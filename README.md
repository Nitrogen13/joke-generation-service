# Anecdote Generation Service
*Anecdote (also known as joke) Generation Service, part of Practical Machine Learning and Deep Learning (PMLDL)
and Modern Application Production (MAP) course.*
*by Ilshat Gibadullin, Timur Valiev, Ilgizar Murzakov, Aidar Valeev*

The goal of the project is to develop a anecdote generation model and frontend to use it 
(web interface or Telegram bot). The finished system will generate random anecdotes on request, 
or take beginning of an anecdote and complete it.

The project can potentially bring a lot of fun and joy into people's lives. 
Our motivation for this project is to improve our language modeling and text generation skills 
(and have fun while doing it).
